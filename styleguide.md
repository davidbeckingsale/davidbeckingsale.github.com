# Style Guide

Taking a cue from [this](http://24ways.org/2011/front-end-style-guides/) great
24 ways article, this page is a style guide for
[davidbeckingsale.com](http://davidbeckingsale.com). The structure of this page
is based on Paul Robert Lloyd's shining
[shining](http://www.paulrobertlloyd.com/about/styleguide/) of a styleguide.

## Sections

The main page title is an `h1` element. The section header above is an `h2`
element.  Primary headers are only to be used for page titles. Secondary
headers can be used for partitioning content on a page.

### Third-Level Header

The `h3` tag can be used for sub-sections, to add more structure to articles..

#### Fourth-Level Header

The primary use of the `h4` tag is to establish a _named_ paragraph in the
document.

##### Fith-Level Header

Try not to use these, but they are styled just in case!

###### Sixth-Level Header

Like the fifth-level header, try not to use these, but they are styled just in
case!

## Logical Content Grouping

Content will be grouped by purpose, using a number of semantic tags. Paragraphs
will be grouped with `p` tags, and `hr` tags can be used to break up blocks of
content. Pre-formatted text will use `pre` tags.

### Paragraphs

All paragraphs will be wrapped in `p` tags by
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).


### Horizontal Rules


The horizontal rule can be used to introduce a stronger break between blocks of
content.

Just like that!

### Pre-formatted text


This will be wrapped in `pre` tags.

    This is some preformatted text!


### Blockquotes

Blockquotes are great for _via_-style posts and quoting directly from other sources. From the 24 ways post mentioned earlier:

> The roles of designer and developer are increasingly blurred, yet all too often we work in isolation. Working side-by-side with designers on web style guides can vastly improve the quality of our work, and the collaborative approach can spark discussions like “how would this work on a smaller screen?”
