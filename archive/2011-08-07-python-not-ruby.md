So, my aim for the summer was to blast through *Seven Programming Languages in Seven Weeks*. That didn't happen, so I tried to learn some Ruby on Rails. That didn't happen. I have managed to get some things done: made a new personal website, completed *Learn Python the Hard Way*, made my first Python app and learned some PyGtk.

I flaked out on learning 7 programming languages because I packed the book away and never got it out again! What happened with RoR is a little more interesting. I got about 60% of the way through Michael Hartl's excellent [Rails Tutorial][1] twice before finally calling it a day. Why couldn't I get on with Ruby on Rails?

Slightly disheartened, I started spending some time writing HTML and CSS, playing with both my [tumblr theme][2] and my [homepage][3]. I had a quick exchange with someone on Twitter who mentioned Python, and I was intrigued. Having heard a lot about Zed Shaw's [Learn Python the Hard Way][4], I made my way over to the website and decided to get started straight away. Working through LPTHW was fairly easy, since it spent alot of time concentrating on programming concepts I was already familiar with. What I needed to know was Python. Completing the series of exercises made me feel like it was time to start a mini project, something to hone what I had just learned, and also to force me to learn more about the language.

My little project was [pymodoro][5], a simple PyGtk app that can be used for following the Pomodoro technique of time management. The end result is a little app that times both the periods of work, and the shorter breaks. It uses pop-up notifications to tell you when to take a break, and when to get back to work. Whilst it is fairly modest, I was quite surprised that I had managed to go from no Python, to a complete app in less than 2 weeks.

The one thing that this has really made me think about was the *feel* of programming languages. Why is it that I couldn't get to grips with RoR, despite many hours and my best intentions, whereas I flew through LPTHW and made a little program with (relative) ease? Do particular programming languages suit certain people better, or should programmers feel comfortable in any language?
