excerpt: Wanting to get more involved with my blog, especially how it looks, I decided to make the switch to Jekyll, a static-site generator written in Ruby

[Jekyll][jk] has been causing quite a stir in the "blogosphere" of late. Many people have been vocal, blogging about their switches (mainly from Wordpress). In this post, I'm going to be joining that group, although hopefully avoiding repeating all the things that have been said before many times.

The main thing I like about jekyll is its simplicity, which allows me to dive into the html and css of my site and get it looking just how I want it, without needing to wrestle with the oodles of php needed for a Wordpress theme.

The second thing is that my site is now hosted on [Github][gh], instead of the crappy free host that I used to have. That means I don't need to worry about it breaking anymore :)
