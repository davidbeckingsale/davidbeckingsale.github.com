Inspired by [Olly's][op] recent baking exploits, and having recently come in to possesion of the [River Cottage Every Day][rc] cookbook, I was inspired to try my hand at some baking, something normally glaringly absent from my culinary repetoir.

The soda bread was surprisingly quick to put together, and I was glad that only minimal kneading was required. After about 20 minutes in the oven, I was a little worried that the crust was colouring a little too quickly, so knocked the temperature down a bit.

The end result was good -- robust, slightly acidic from the baking soda, and very edible. The drier texture of soda bread meant that after a few days it still tasted nearly as good as it did when it was first baked.
