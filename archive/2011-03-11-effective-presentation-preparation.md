excerpt: I'm not one for "top-tips", but my top presentation tip, is practising as much as possible!

I'm not really one for "top-tips", but I recently had to give a presentation and I tried something I had never really done before: rehearse. I can speak to an audience without much preparation, so I used to ignore my presentation practice because I knew that it would end up being okay. I used running away from practice to try and reduce my nerves. This time I really needed to do a good job, and after I'd finished preparing my slides and planning the talk I started practising. I just ran through the presentation in my room, by myself, over and over until it started feeling smooth. This rehearsing really helped to reduce my nerves, far more than trying to hide away from it. So my "top-tip" is rehearse until you feel comfortable, it really helps.
