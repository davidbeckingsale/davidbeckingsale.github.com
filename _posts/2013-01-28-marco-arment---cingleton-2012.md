[Marco Arment's][marco] talk from [Çingleton 2012][cingleton] is a great watch.
I really like the message he is conveying. To scale your skills, you need to
put yourself in an environment that forces your skills to scale. It almost
happens automatically. It's a refreshing change from the idea that to be good,
you have to make incredible sacrifices and focus on one thing to the
exclusion of everything else.
