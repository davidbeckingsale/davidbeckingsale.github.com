excerpt: A narrative about my attempt to switch keyboard layouts, from qwerty to colemak.

Considering that I spend a large portion of my day at the computer - either thinking or typing - I decided it was time to investigate a more ergonomic keyboard layout. No doubt you will have heard that the qwerty layout was intentionally designed to slow down the best typists, in order to stop them breaking the typewriters! Despite this, Qwerty became the de-facto keyboard layout for the English speaking world, and has been crippling its users ever since.

The first "other" layout I heard about was Dvorak, an intentionally ergonomic layout designed by Dr. August Dvorak and patented in 1936. As I started to investigate further I came across [Colemak][1] which was released in 2006. After some further research, I decided that I would spend some time and try and learn colemak...

The main reason for my decision to learn colemak is the fact that in alot of cases, total finger distance is far lower than qwerty and Dvorak. [Carpalx][2] shows that colemak requires far less effort that both qwerty and dvorak. The detailed statistics simply highlight the features of the layout - lots of home row usage, balanced hand use and good hand alternation. There are a number of arguments for and against any keyboard layout, so whilst I would recommend colemak, it is definitely worth doing your own research, specifically if you type lots of non-standard words or sequences of characters.

#### Learning Colemak

As I began to learn colemak, I found it fairly easy. I continued to use qwerty the majority of the time but spent roughly 10-20 minutes each evening practising with colemak. After around 2 weeks, my speeds had not progressed much past 20 WPM for colemak, and I was maintaining a 60+ WPM in qwerty. I then decided to start typing everything using colemak. This brought about a swift increase in my competence, and I felt like I really knew where all the keys were. However, this came with a downside - my qwerty skills really suffered. I found my self hitting completely the wrong keys and my speed dropped dramatically. It took about 30 minutes of constant practising in qwerty to feel even a little bit comfortable again. Only around 4 hours of 20-30 WPM typing with colemak caused this shift. This is not too much of a problem as once I reach 50+ WPM in colemak I plan to use it permanently on my home computers, however, there is nothing more frustrating than sitting down at a computer and feeling completely handicapped by your typing, so I would definitely recommend maintaining your qwerty skills, simply because of the dominace of the layout.

On the whole I think the learning process is definitely easy and well worth trying. As my speed increases I feel more and more of the benefit of colemak, there are lots of key-combos that I really enjoy typing. If you are thinking of learning colemak I would suggest you go for it, and if possible, make the switch cold turkey, spending only a few minutes a day maintaining your qwerty skills. If you have already switched and find your qwerty speed suffering, just take a few minutes each day to really focus on qwerty, and you should find your speeds recovering quite quickly.

Below are a couple of graphs, one of my qwerty speed and one of my colemak speed. The qwerty graph is on the left and the colemak graph on the right. The high speeds on the colemak graph at the start are due to me only practising the home row. The sudden drop occurs when I started typing all letters. The last 2 days of qwerty are the speed drop that I talked about above.
