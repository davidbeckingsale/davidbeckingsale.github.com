excerpt: Is a minimalist workspace useful for anything?

I came across [Pat Dryburgh's][pd] [post][sdp] about shutting down Simple Desks via [Ben Brooks's][br] site. I understand his (and many other people's) position on these _minimalist_ workspaces. However, I do have a few thoughts on the utility of a _minimalist_ or more correctly, a tidy workspace.

The above quote is from Pat's [article][sdp] referencing an episode of Back to Work, which I also listened, to that first got me thinking about _minimalist_ workspaces.

Something that I don't think has been mentioned and perhaps should be is the difference between a _minimalist_ desk, and a _tidy_ desk. The distinction is subtle here, much like the distinction between __life__ _hacks_ and _life_ __hacks__[^fn]. 

I think the whole point of a minimalist workspace, to me anyway, is to remove any fake barriers to work. Would you rather sit down and start working in a bomb site, or a desk that looks like it was straight out of the Ikea catalogue?

Once you start work, your desk will quite likely turn into a tip. This is how it should be. When I have been at my desk for a few hours there will inevitably be paper, pens, crumbs, coffee mugs, and other assorted detritus all over it. At the end of the day though, I will make an effort to clean everything back up, so I know that the next morning, the thought of spending 20 minutes futzing around and tidying won't even cross my mind.

Regardless of the sketiscism with which you regard these _minimalist_ workspaces, bear in the mind the barriers you might accidently create for yourself by effectively saying _"F*** it"_, and leaving your workspace in mess.
