<p>Having got my iPad recently, I have been assessing it&#8217;s suitability as a device for actually <em>working</em> on. My main reason for purchasing the device was something for reading PDFs, but my main use for it so far has been writing.</p>

<p>PDFs on the iPad are far nicer than on the kindle, scrolling and zooming are as smooth as you would expect, far surpassing the jumpy feel of the Kindle&#8217;s e-paper screen. I was worried that the screen might be too bright for reading, but so far that hasn&#8217;t been the case. The crisp screen makes things look good, even PDFs that I have produced.</p>

<p>So, where am I in terms of doing some actual work? Like most people, a large amount of the work I do on the computer involves writing - documents, blog posts, LaTeX, code - all text files. The first thing I set up was <a href="www.simplenote.app-spot.com">Simplenote</a>, to give me an easy way to capture notes on the iPad. I&#8217;m a big fan of Evernote, especially the way it lets you create notebooks full of mixed content. I use it to store notes for university, where I have a combination of related materials of differing file types. However, I find that sometimes it&#8217;s a bit too cluttered and the text only Simplenote offers a better experience just for writing.</p>

<p>Capturing notes is all well and good, but what really helped me get some work done was a real text editor. I picked <a href="http://www.textasticapp.com/">Textastic</a> after some quick searching and reading some reviews. Luckily I had an iTunes voucher, so it was effectively free, but if I hadn&#8217;t had a voucher I would have had no problems shelling out the Â£2.99 to buy it. Textastic has a number of great features that make it suitable for working away from the computer. Dropbox sync is great, you select a file from your Dropbox and download it. You then open up the local file and do whatever you want with it. After that though you need to remember to upload the file to Dropbox again in order for the changes to appear in your Dropbox account. The next nice feature is code highlighting. This works in all kinds of files, and obviously it&#8217;s particularly useful in code. I haven&#8217;t got round to any heavy duty coding on the iPad yet, but I did open a LaTeX file and found it to be highlighted perfectly. One last nifty feature I came across was markdown previewing, you can write up your markdown document in Textastic, then hit a preview button to flip right over to a preview of the HTML generated from the markdown.</p>

<p>So far, this is all the &#8220;work&#8221; I have really done on my iPad, I&#8217;m even drafting this post in Simplenote. I&#8217;m sure as I continue to use the iPad there will be other things I start to use it for, but for now I&#8217;m happy just with text editing. Don&#8217;t underestimate the power of the iPad as a tool for working. I remember seeing the iPad described as a device for consumption somewhere, but so far I haven&#8217;t found that to be the case.</p>
