I've been looking for a way to keep track of what I have got done everyday, when
I stumbled on [this][jgist] script by [Jered Benoit][jb], via [Brett Terpstra][bt].

I don't use DayOne, so I forked the script and tweaked it to output to a dated
Markdown file in my `~/Dropbox/notes/` folder, which is where I point both [NvALT][nv]
and [Simplenote][sn]. The script is available as a
[gist][mygist], so hopefully someone else might find this useful.
