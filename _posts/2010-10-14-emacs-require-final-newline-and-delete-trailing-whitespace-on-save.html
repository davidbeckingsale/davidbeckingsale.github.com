Here are two useful features I have recently added to my emacs configuration:

<strong>Final Newline</strong>

[code light="true"] (setq-default require-final-newline t) [/code]

This makes sure that all files are saved with a final newline character. This is useful for programming, since it is a requirement of some languages.

<strong>Delete Trailing Whitespace (on save)</strong>

[code light="true"] (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace) [/code]

Another useful feature for writing code in emacs, helps keep things tidy by deleting trailing whitespace every time you save a file.
