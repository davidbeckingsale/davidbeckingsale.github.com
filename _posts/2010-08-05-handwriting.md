In this age of computing, there is one great skill falling into decline - handwriting. Don't get me wrong, I'm just as interested in scanning, pdfs, paperless stuff, but what happens when you actually _need_ to communicate by hand? Looking at this from a technological standpoint, there are a number of use cases that I can think of, I'll name just a couple.

Firstly, letters to friends or relatives. It might seem a bit old fashioned, but a handwritten letter has so much more gravity than an email or a text. You might be telling your grandma about a new job, or if you're a bit younger, maybe a thankyou letter or a bit of news from school or university. Secondly, communication which will be delivered by "snail mail" to some business. A good example here would be a letter to a bank. It might just be something simple like asking for a cheque to be payed in (you were only in town on a Sunday and wanted to get it done). But a formal, well written letter is just so much nicer than your auto-formatted Word junk.

It is important to note that I love documents that have been typeset on the computer and every time I use LaTeX I smile at how pretty it is. I just think it's important to remember that there is a time and a place for handwritten communication. So hopefully we have established that writing is sometimes simply the best way to do things. This brings me to my next point. Bad handwriting! In my experience it is dire how bad handwriting is and has become. In school, I was taught fairly well, but with no real purpose. You had to know joined-up writing, but once you did, that was it. Really there is no excuse for bad handwriting. People will spend hours on IRC and IM, chatting until they are typing at 120WPM, but if they need to handwrite something, it is nothing more than a scribble. The real problem with handwriting is that it requires a lot of practise and dedication in order to improve, because you need to spend so much time unlearning the bad habits you have picked up as you write less and less frequently. When I looked over my illegible lecture notes I knew that I needed to do something! I want to try and seaerate the two halves of this rant in order to try and make it more readable, so please forgive me for ending in what seems like mid flow.
