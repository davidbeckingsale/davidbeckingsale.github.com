So after my last <a href="http://www.davidbeckingsale.com/blog/emacs-and-org-mode-for-getting-things-done">post</a> where I discussed org-mode and GTD, this might seem a little strange. This is true, I am as fickle as a teenage girl (thanks <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=fickle+as+a">Google</a>).

What I want to talk about is where I find org-mode really falls down. In terms of power and its flexibility, I have no criticisms. Anything you can think of, you can configure org to do. The one thing that really gets me is what the task lists look like. I know what you're thinking - "that's not important, noob!" - but I urge you to reconsider. In the more graphical task managers, <a href="www.nirvanahq.com">Nirvana</a> for example, the tasks really pop out as separate little items, easy to see at a glance what a single task is. I find the task views in org-mode just so cluttered. I know it's just text, but that is the problem!

I'm aware of all the contradictions creeping into my blog, so I would urge you not to take any of my advice! Try things for yourself and see what happens.
