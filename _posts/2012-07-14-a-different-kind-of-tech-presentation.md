excerpt: A great example of an informative technical presentation from Rob Conery at NDC 2012.

Rob Conery's [presentation][pres] from the Norwegian Developers Conference is
well worth a watch. Rather than flash up some slides and example code that
doesn't really tell you anything about the language, he decided to code. Just
code. As he says on his blog:

> I sat down and coded to some fun music for 50 solid minutes.

The video is well worth a watch as it really gets across the atmosphere of the
room, and the music fits the presentation almost perfectly.
Rob makes surprisingly few typos (I forget how to touch type if someone walks
past me!), and the presentation flows smoothly through many aspects of Node. I
feel like I learned more from casually watching this than I would have from
spending a few hours typing out "Hello, world!" tutorials, and I really thing
that is what Rob was trying to put across.

A fantastic model for tech presentations, if you can pull it off!
