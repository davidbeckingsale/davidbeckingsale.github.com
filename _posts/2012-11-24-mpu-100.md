excerpt: MPU's 100th episode featured some great academic workflows.
---

In August, the Mac Power Users [podcast][mpu] reached its [100th][mpu100]
episode. They were joined by a number of listeners who shared their Mac
workflows. The most useful thing were the academics featured
in the episode.

They talked about a load of great tools, including my favourites
[Papers][papers] and [Skim][skim], and shared some great ways of using these
more efficiently.  If you are an academic and use a Mac (quite likely from my
experience), then you should really check it out!
