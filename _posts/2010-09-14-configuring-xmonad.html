Following the submission of my xmonad config to the xmonad reddit, I wanted to write a post that explained what I have done in a bit more detail.

<!--more -->

<a href="http://www.xmonad.org">Xmonad</a>, my window manager of choice, lies at the very heart of my config. It is accompanied by <a href="http://conky.sourceforge.net/">conky</a> and <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/gotmor/dzen">dzen</a>, 2 utilities very much at home with this minimalistic tiling WM.

Conky provides a way to display information, which is used to display the CPU information, RAM information, network information, and the time. Conky is controlled with a simple textfile. In my config, this is ".conky_bar"

Dzen provides the actual bars for information to reside in. The bar at the top of the screen is actually 3 separate items: a dzen bar for workspace and window information, the conky powered bar for stats and finally trayer provides a system tray.

I used the zenburn colour scheme as the basis of my theme. I like dark themes, but sometimes find that blank (#000000) based themes can be a little too dark. The lighter grey of zenburn is a perfect choice,Â  and the fact that the colour scheme has been built up for a number of years has provided me with a good palette to use as the base for my config.

Building my config allowed me to develop a greater understanding of xmonad and Haskell, as well as letting me gain some experience with conky. I think the most important thing to emphasise about my config, is that the majority of it is very simple, and purely aesthetic.

If you use xmonad, I would imagine you are already using your own config. If not, or if you would just like some more ideas, I strongly recommend you take a look at the <a href="http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Config_archive">xmonad config archive</a>.

If you decide you want to build up a configuration of your own there are a few tips that I would like to share:
<ul>
	<li>Find or create a colour scheme. Simple is often best.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Make use of simple keybindings for your frequent tasks (this is less related to the aesthetics of your setup and more to usability).</li>
</ul>
