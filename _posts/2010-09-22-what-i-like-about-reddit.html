So, what do I like about <a href="http://www.reddit.com">reddit</a>?

I think the key to the success of reddit is the amount of very specific subreddits that exist (and that can be created). Two of my favourite are the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs">emacs reddit</a> and the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/xmonad">xmonad reddit</a>. These are the perfect place to go to discover targeted links and comments that are likely to be of particular interest to emacs and xmonad users respectively. Since these are 2 of my favourites it is no surprise that the majority of content that appears there is of specific interest to me.

One of the general reddits that I visit is programming. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming">/r/programming</a> reminds be of Digg's <a href="http://www.digg.com/technology">technology</a> section as it was quite a few years ago. The content is always up to date, and  although I have been visiting for a few months now, I have yet to see the reposting like the kind rampant on digg. It's definitely the place to check out if you are sick of "Top 10 Ubuntu tips" type articles, and are really looking to expand the breadth of your knowledge in the field  of programming.

If you haven't been on reddit yet, the I recommend taking a look. I think you be pleasantly surprised with the amount of quality content that appears there each day. It certainly is an easy way to kill an hour or two.
