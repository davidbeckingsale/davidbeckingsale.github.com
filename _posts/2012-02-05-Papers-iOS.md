excerpt: Setting up a collection to show you unread papers on the Papers iOS app
---

When I first purchased [Papers][papers] for Mac, I was enamoured with it's feature set. I
would probably describe it as 'iTunes for Papers'. One of the things I liked
the most was how it would highlight any unread papers in your collection,
making it easy to see what you needed to read. When I bought the [iOS version][papersIOS]
from the App Store later the same day, I was disappointed to find that
identifying my unread papers on the iPad was far less trivial, impossible
in fact.

After a couple of days mulling things over, I hit upon a simple and easy to
implement solution. Simply create a new _Smart Collection_, and then use the
following settings:

    Display Papers matching all of the following conditions:  
        Paper read NO

And there you have it, an _Unread Papers_ collection on your iOS device. I
still haven't figured out how to mark things as read when I'm on the go, so if
you know how to do that then please let me know.
