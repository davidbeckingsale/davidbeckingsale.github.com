<p>So, my aim for the summer was to blast through <em>Seven Programming Languages in Seven Weeks</em>. That didn't happen, so I tried to learn some Ruby on Rails. That didn't happen. I have managed to get some things done: made a new personal website, completed <em>Learn Python the Hard Way</em>, made my first Python app and learned some PyGtk.</p>

<p>I flaked out on learning 7 programming languages because I packed the book away and never got it out again! What happened with RoR is a little more interesting. I got about 60% of the way through Michael Hartl's excellent <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Rails Tutorial</a> twice before finally calling it a day. Why couldn't I get on with Ruby on Rails?</p>

<p>Slightly disheartened, I started spending some time writing HTML and CSS, playing with both my <a href="http://bytes.davidbeckingsale.com">tumblr theme</a> and my <a href="http://www.davidbeckingsale.com">homepage</a>. I had a quick exchange with someone on Twitter who mentioned Python, and I was intrigued. Having heard a lot about Zed Shaw's <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>, I made my way over to the website and decided to get started straight away. Working through LPTHW was fairly easy, since it spent alot of time concentrating on programming concepts I was already familiar with. What I needed to know was Python. Completing the series of exercises made me feel like it was time to start a mini project, something to hone what I had just learned, and also to force me to learn more about the language.</p>

<p>My little project was <a href="https://github.com/davidbeckingsale/pymodoro">pymodoro</a>, a simple PyGtk app that can be used for following the Pomodoro technique of time management. The end result is a little app that times both the periods of work, and the shorter breaks. It uses pop-up notifications to tell you when to take a break, and when to get back to work. Whilst it is fairly modest, I was quite surprised that I had managed to go from no Python, to a complete app in less than 2 weeks.</p>

<p>The one thing that this has really made me think about was the <em>feel</em> of programming languages. Why is it that I couldn't get to grips with RoR, despite many hours and my best intentions, whereas I flew through LPTHW and made a little program with (relative) ease? Do particular programming languages suit certain people better, or should programmers feel comfortable in any language?</p>
