excerpt: Using HTML and CSS to prototype web designs
---

It feels like I'm always redesigning this site. Mostly, it's because I am, and
I think that anyone who has gone to the trouble of designing and coding up
their own website will inevitably find themselves in the design/implement/redesign
cycle.

Normally, the style of my site is based around what I _can_ do, rather than what
I have in mind. This normally happens because I work in HTML and CSS, rather
than prototyping in something like Photoshop. This time around I decided to come
up with a solid prototype before messing around with code, so did some googling
to see what I could find. I came across a great post on [24 ways](http://24ways.org) -- [Make Your Mockup in Markup](http://24ways.org/2009/make-your-mockup-in-markup) -- which presents a great
series of steps for developing your design without resorting to an image editor.
