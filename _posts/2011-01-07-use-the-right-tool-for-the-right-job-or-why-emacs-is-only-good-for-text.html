When I first started using emacs, I got sucked in to the its-all-text mindset. Everything I did was a plain text file. And it was awesome! Lists, notes, code, even browsing the web - if it could be done in emacs, then it was done. I couldn't understand why other people weren't doing this. Text, so simple, so elegant; what could be better?

Well, it turns out that there are a number use cases when emacs isn't the optimal tool. I was clearing out my downloads and I noticed that I had a lot of payment receipts as PDF files (I print to pdf since I don't generally have my laptop plugged into a printer). I wanted to move these files out of my downloads and archived somewhere. Enter Evernote, I dragged the files in to the desktop app, tagged them as "receipts" and deleted them from my hard drive. Newer tools have the edge on emacs since they integrate so well with newer technology.

One thing that I just don't understand is email in emacs. When email consistent of text and little else I bet there was nothing better, but these days email is a lot more than just text. If someone (less morally enlightened than the typical emacs user)  sends me a docx file, I will get in in gmail, hit "Preview in google docs" and them take a quick peek. Here's how I imagine this might happen for a typical emacs user: they receive the file and spend ~2 minutes cursing the idiot that still uses proprietary formats (and not a text file), then they would have to remember that the Open Office equivalent of word can be started with "oowriter" (obviously these guys aren't using something as amateur as Gnome of KDE), then they could have a quick look at the file.

There is no point in arguing whether emacs is a good text editor, it's vintage and the number of high-profile users speaks for itself. However, it's important to use it for what it was intended. For powering through code or other files that are meant to be text based, there's nothing easier.

I really question how many people use emacs for whatever task  because it's the best, or because they can. I really enjoying using emacs for everyday tasks, but sometimes I feel like it's trying to get a square peg in around hole.
