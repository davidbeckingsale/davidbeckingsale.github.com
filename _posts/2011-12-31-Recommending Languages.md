excerpt: On why recommending one specific programming language is better than recommending them all.

## Don't just tell someone to choose any language they want, actually recommend one!

I recently saw a post on [Hacker News][hn], where someone asked what language they should try and learn. Looking at the answers, I was relieved to see  people recommending specific programming languages, something that doesn't normally happen when someone asks for advice in this area.

Normally, the response consists of something like: _"Don't worry which is the best language, just pick any one,"_ or _"I like languages X, and Y, but also Z, sometimes Z', so I would recommend any of those."_ Coming from someone who can still remember what it was like learning to program for the first time, I want to say, don't do this!

Once you understand how to program, a response like _"Pick any language and just build something"_ seems like the correct one. The most important part of improving as a programmer is programming. However, when you are just getting started, this is exactly what you don't want to hear. People will always tell you not to get bogged down in trying to pick the best language, but this is exactly what a beginners problem can be. Telling someone in this position to pick any language is not going to help at all, you will just send them back to Google, back to trying to pick the perfect language to get started with.

This is why I was both surprised and relieved to see some of  the responses on Hacker News recommending one, and only one, language to use. This is exactly the kind of advice I would have wanted. There are an abundance of resources related to learning programming in any language you might choose: Python, Ruby, C, Java, C++; the list goes on and on. This is why I feel that for a lot of people, actually picking a language is the hardest step, especially if you follow any of the more popular programming news type sites ([r/programming][rp] and [Hacker News][hni] being two good examples), where the rise and fall of programming languages is never far from peoples minds. 

So the next time you see someone asking this type of question, I would encourage you to recommend one language, be it your current favourite, or maybe even the language you started with, hopefully if enough people answer with the same language, the confused novice will be able to choose that language and get moving.
