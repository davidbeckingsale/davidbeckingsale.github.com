David Heinemeier Hansson [tweeted][tweet] a link to a great [post][post] on the 37signals blog about using Ruby on Rails for Basecamp.

It's interesting that most comments portray the relative infancy of Ruby on Rails, in a way that would seem completely foreign today:

> What is MVC? (...I'm a curious newbie programmer sitting on the sidelines listening intently to this conversation...)

To which dhh replies:

> MVC is a way to separate the three basic concerns of an application into isolated tiers, which can be constructed, tweaked, and tested apart from the others. MVC is short for Model, View, Control.

Which technologies are you beginning to understand today, that you couldn't imagine people _not_ understanding in a few years?
