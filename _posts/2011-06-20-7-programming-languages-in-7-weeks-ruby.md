Something I think about a lot is how hard it is to learn new programming languages. Especially once you have learned your first language, it is harder to go back to taking those baby steps as you re-learn to program. In order to try and remedy this I purchased Bruce Tate's [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks][1], a book from the Pragmatic Programmers about learning to program. 

## Week 1 - Ruby

The first language that is taught is [Ruby][2], something I have already dabbled with on a couple of occasions, but don't have any real knowledge of. I breezed through the introduction, and I already had Ruby installed, so I continued to the first "day". I like the approach that Tate takes to teaching programming languages, giving firm but friendly instruction rather than limp wristed suggestions of boring projects. The pace of the text is good, and the scope is sufficiently constrained making it easy to follow. The self-study tasks provide some concrete suggestions of thngs to try in order to learn a bit more. Given the amount of material that needs to be covered, a lot of the more finicky details are left out. This isn't really a problem however, since the self-study tasks are geared to preparing you for issues like this. Whilst this is not my first experience with Ruby, I do feel like I have learned some new stuff. Having the concrete instructions and self-study tasks has made it a lot easier to learn more. Next week I am moving on to the second language in the book, [io][3], and I'm really looking forwrd to it.
