Java was my first programming language, and the only programming language I have any real experience with. I've written about 2000 lines of C#, but not enough to really start to think in the language.

Given the recent developments in the Java sphere, I decided it was time to try and decide on a new language. Wanting a break from the imperative paradigm, I decided to try and find a functional language. After a brief flirtation with Haskell (I use xmonad) I decided to give Scheme a try. Downloading and installing Racket, I was eagerly anticipating learning something new. I needed to find a way to learn this new language.

The book How to Design Programs receives numerous recommendations from all over the internet, so I decided to give it a try. The thing that astounded me about trying to learn a new language is how difficult it is. I've been using Java for about 3 years, so I had long forgotten the pain of trying to understand how to program with a new language. I think this becomes even worse when you already know how to program. I was thinking of things I wanted to try, that I knew I could achieve in Java, but just had no idea how or where to start.

HtDP is a great book and the exercises really make it worthwhile. It was a very humbling experience going back to writing simple functions that double numbers or similar trivial calculations.The thing I think that HtDP does best is show you how to use data is Scheme to solve problems. The fact that there are no types makes this very different from a language such as Java. In my opinion it makes it very elegant to solve problems using any type of data.

Structs are introduced early in the book and used for a number of interesting problems. The one that grabbed me with its elegance is the struct they use for describing the node of a family tree (define-struct child (father mother name date eyes)), where mother and father are also child structs (or empty). This simple definition contains enough information for performing operations on a collection of the structs that represent a tree. It is easy to walk through this tree by recursing on the mother and father items of each child struct.

I am still working my way through the book, and really enjoying learning a new way to reason about and solve problems.
