        <div class="excerpt"><p>Ideas, and more specifically capturing ideas, is something that I struggle with. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m worried that I don&#8217;t know where to put them, but I always seem to feel a sense of dread when I have an idea. It makes its way into my inbox, and then I&#8217;m paralysed. Admitting that this idea can be realised. Picking a next action. The correlation between concrete steps and seeing the idea birthed. It can be too much. So it sits there for a while, only to become a half-baked &#8220;look into&#8221; type task.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not how things get done. While projects are driven by next actions, you&#8217;ll never bring down a monster if you spend all day swatting flies. Projects are driven by passion - whether you know it or not. If you are passionate about a project then it will get done. I don&#8217;t mean passion as in something all consuming and highly romanticised. It can be short-lived. A fleeting five minutes spent engrossed in a Wikipedia article. Often, it turns into an hour or more solving some problem that cropped up whilst you were working. This kind of passion, and the relentless need to get some <em>specific</em> thing done, can often snowball.</p>

<p>As I sat down and reworked this site for the third time in two years, I was turning to the project after letting it sit dormant for a few months. Originally, I wanted to create some kind of dynamic landing page, a big advert for everything I do online. I have no idea why I was pretending that&#8217;s what I wanted my website to be. I just want somewhere to write. If I&#8217;m recognised on the Internet, I want it to be for my writing.</p>

<p>The rework turned out better than expected, and ended up being completed far sooner than I anticipated. Once I thought about why I wanted to change the aesthetics of my site, I realised it was not the aesthetics that I wanted to change. It was the purpose. This clarity drove me towards cleaning up the design, giving myself permission to change without the baggage of the old posts I would rather forget.</p>

<p>Discovering this purpose turned the project into a passion. Other things were left by the wayside as I pressed ahead with getting this finished. I&#8217;m glad I did. Finishing something big is better than finishing one hundred tiny things.</p>

<p>Let your passion snowball, driving you to complete bigger projects in great leaps, not tiny steps.</p></div>

        <div class="excerpt"><p>In the past few years, if you have been one of the very small number of people to have stumbled upon this blog, you will have noticed a distinct lack of two things in my posts: quality, and frequency. I&#8217;m not sure why it&#8217;s been such a struggle to really get this blog off the ground, but it has.</p>

<p>Whilst, like everyone else, I agree that resolutions are a pretty bad idea, I have <em>resolved</em> to expend significant effort this year in improving the kind of content I create and share on this very website.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I&#8217;m going to focus on creating the kind of content that I love to consume. Blogs like <a href='http://hackmake.org/'>Hack / Make</a>, <a href='http://macdrifter.com/'>Macdrifter</a>, and <a href='http://bettermess.com/'>A Better Mess</a>, as well as podcasts like <a href='http://5by5.tv/b2w'>Back To Work</a> are a huge influence on the way I work, and the way that I view tainted buzzwords like &#8220;productivity&#8221;. Whilst I don&#8217;t consider myself to be in the same league as those guys, it helps to know your heroes. Hopefully, in the coming months the posts here will drill down into the personal issues that we face with our struggle to get more done. By integrating deeper concepts, borrowed from areas such as Bhuddism, into the tips &#8216;n&#8217; tricks popular with the Lifehacker crowd, we can hope to create systems that are both meaningful and practical, without getting lost in the details.</p>

<p>Avoiding the numerous traps you set for your self on the journey to creating something can be a tricky business. When I decided to revamp and refocus this blog on what I actually care about, my next action was &#8220;find a new tool&#8221;. After only a few months with Jekyll, I was already looking for something new to fiddle with. Bombarding myself with &#8220;what if&#8221; questions, I was trying to prematurely optimise the blog with feature after feature, meaningless cruft that would only serve to distract from any posts that I have managed to craft into an engaging narrative. After a few days deep in the throes of a CMS identity crisis, something clicked: this doesn&#8217;t matter. The forever and a day that I could spend worrying about which static blogging system to play with, which font to use, which CSS framework to base the site, would only get in the way of the actual creating - the whole reason I wanted to overhaul this site in the first place.</p>

<p>Picking the right tool for the job isn&#8217;t easy, and with a virtually limitless amount of information available on the web, finding the perfect tool is damn near impossible. Don&#8217;t look for the perfect tool. Understanding what you really want, identifying your desired outcomes, frees you from concerns about tools. The meaning behind what you create, whether you have it in a professionally-themed Wordpress blog or a plain-text Gist on GitHub, remains the same. I don&#8217;t want to let meaning be obscured, or delayed, by tools.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s never been a better time to be mindful of the way you work.</p></div>

        <div class="excerpt"><p>Often, when processing journal RSS feeds, I&#8217;ll find quite a few articles that I want to read. I use <a href='http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/'>Papers2</a> to manage my papers, so the first thing I need to do is import these newly-downloaded files.</p>

<p>The <a href='https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid'><code>maid</code></a> gem makes this easy to do automatically. I&#8217;ve added the following rule to my <code>rules.rb</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>rule &#39;Add PDFs to Papers2&#39; do
  dir(&#39;~/Downloads/*.pdf&#39;).each do |path|
    is_paper = `mdfind -onlyin ~/Downloads/ computing`

      if is_paper.include?(path)
        `open -a Papers2 &quot;#{path}&quot;`
      end
  end
end</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s not perfect, but it <em>is</em> perfectly functional. Every time I run <code>maid
clean</code>, any PDFs that contain the word &#8220;computing&#8221; will be automatically imported into Papers. Obviously the word used to select papers will vary depending on your field, but the rule is trivial to modify.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s about becoming. Becoming is cyclical and perpetual. When you think you&#8217;ve “arrived”, you’re only just at the beginning of a new place. In this cycle of becoming is where you have to give and take between the burden and the solace of creating great things. At times, you&#8217;ll be burdened by your desire to make something insanely great. That will lead you into a path of suffering and discouragement; a place of character building and of gaining understanding. In the other season of that cycle comes actualization and a freedom to create the great things you just struggled to find in yourself.</p>

<p>Normally, the style of my site is based around what I <em>can</em> do, rather than what I have in mind. This normally happens because I work in HTML and CSS, rather than prototyping in something like Photoshop. This time around I decided to come up with a solid prototype before messing around with code, so did some googling to see what I could find. I came across a great post on <a href='http://24ways.org'>24 ways</a> &#8211; <a href='http://24ways.org/2009/make-your-mockup-in-markup'>Make Your Mockup in Markup</a> &#8211; which presents a great series of steps for developing your design without resorting to an image editor.</p></div>

Rather than flash up some slides and example code that doesn&#8217;t really tell you anything about the language, he decided to code. Just code. As he says on his blog:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I sat down and coded to some fun music for 50 solid minutes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The video is well worth a watch as it really gets across the atmosphere of the room, and the music fits the presentation almost perfectly. Rob makes surprisingly few typos (I forget how to touch type if someone walks past me!), and the presentation flows smoothly through many aspects of Node. I feel like I learned more from casually watching this than I would have from spending a few hours typing out &#8220;Hello, world!&#8221; tutorials, and I really thing that is what Rob was trying to put across.</p>

        <div class="excerpt"><p>Like most people these days, I&#8217;d like to blog more. A key part of that is finding things to write about. Whenever I had an idea, I would open up nvALT, find my list of ideas, then add a new idea to the bottom. None of those steps are too difficult, but they do cause a fairly lengthy disruption if you are in the middle of something else. To streamline the process, I used <a href='http://www.alfredapp.com/'>Alfred</a>, an application launcher from <a href='http://www.runningwithcrayons.com/'>Running With Crayons</a>.</p>

<p>One great feature of Alfred is the ability to trigger a shell script, along with passing it an optional parameter. A simple shell script to log ideas would look something like this:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>	<span class='nb'>echo</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;idea&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/Dropbox/notes/blog_ideas.txt
</code></pre></div>
<p>Combining that with Alfred means that I can replace whatever is inside the quotes with a parameter that Alfred will pass to the script. The value this parameter takes will be whatever you type after the keyword you use to trigger your script. The actual script you need to put in Alfred looks something like this:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='nb'>echo</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;- {query}&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; /Users/david/Dropbox/notes/blog_ideas.md 
    <span class='o'>&amp;&amp;</span> <span class='nb'>echo</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;Added {query} to blog ideas…&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I use a hyphen at the start of the item because I maintain my file as a markdown list. The echo at the end gives me a <a href='http://growl.info/'>Growl</a> notification with whatever was added to my list of ideas. I can now hit ⌘-Space to bring up Alfred, then type &#8220;blog &#8216;new idea&#8217;&#8220;, and get a new line at the end of my ideas file.</p></div>

        <div class="excerpt"><p>Yesterday, I took the plunge and invested a whole ~£4.50 buying <a href='http://dayoneapp.com/'>DayOne</a> for both OS X and iOS. The app is billed as</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The easiest to use journal / diary / text logging application for the Mac&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and I think that is probably true. So far, I&#8217;ve only written about six (short) entries over two days, but I&#8217;m really enjoying the simple, clean, interface.</p>

<p>What I think will become a key feature for me are the reminders. I used to use <a href='http://ohlife.com/'>ohlife</a> for keeping a journal, something I stuck with for a just over a month, and one of the best features there were the daily email reminders to make an entry. However, whilst it was easy to hit reply and submit your entry, I don&#8217;t think a mail client is where most people do their best writing &#8211; certainly not their most intimate.</p>

<p>The first thing I did when I installed DayOne was to work out how to import my old ohlife entries, something that currently needs to be done using the <code>dayone</code> command line tool. It is very simple to use, and the <a href='https://gist.github.com/977766'>sample script</a> they provide, along with Brett Terpstra&#8217;s <a href='http://brettterpstra.com/logging-with-day-one-geek-style/'>post</a> on using DayOne from the command line had me well on my way to getting my old entries imported.</p>

<p>The ohlife export file simply contains all your entries, with a simple date, content format. I whipped up a quick ruby <a href='https://github.com/davidbeckingsale/ohlife-to-dayone.rb'>script</a> to parse my file and create the new entries and I was done.</p>

<p>Flicking through these old entries (from last August) really highlighted the benefits of keeping some kind of daily log of thoughts/feelings/actions, and it was really interesting to read through some of my old entries, knowing that things I was worrying about had turned out fine, and how things I&#8217;d wanted to happen have now come to pass.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m feeling quite positive that DayOne will help me log enough about each day to be able to look back in 6 months or a year and (hopefully) feel good about what I have done since then!</p></div>
