        <div class="excerpt"><p><a href='http://www.abolish.me/blog/semantic-notes'>Tyler Reinhard&#8217;s</a> system for dealing with notes is perfect. It&#8217;s well thought out, and well documented. Reading through the post inspired me to try and improve my notetaking, and more importantly, my note processing.</p>

<p>I think the key part of Tyler&#8217;s system here is making sure that any notes in your &#8220;inbox&#8221; are named with two leading spaces, for example:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;  check this out.md&quot;</code></pre>

<p>Having notes named like this makes it very easy to sort by name in <a href='http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/'>nvALT</a> and see all the notes you still need to process. The filename-based scheme works really well with <a href='http://agiletortoise.com/drafts'>Drafts</a>, especially since they added variable support to file names in a recent update.</p>

<p>To send items from Drafts to my notes inbox, I created the following action:</p>

<p><img alt='Drafts to Notes Inbox Action' src='/img/drafts-add-to-notes-inbox.png' /></p>

<p>Using the &#8220;Predefined&#8221; file option, in combination with the <code>[[title]]</code> variable means that the note will be named correctly, and then saved to my <code>~/Dropbox/notes</code> folder. It will then show up in the right place, and hopefully get processed.</p></div>

        <h1><a href="/2013/02/10/on-notebooks.html">On Notebooks</a></h1>
        
        <div class="date">February 10, 2013 &bullet; <a href="/2013/02/10/on-notebooks.html">∞</a></div> 
        <div class="excerpt"><p>What&#8217;s the first thing you do when you start a new project that will have a significant analogue component? If you said&#8212;&#8220;Grab a new notebook!&#8221;&#8212;then you&#8217;re not alone. This need to start a new notebook for every project is fuelled by the desire for organisation. Compared to digital documents, which can be easily copied, aliased, moved, filed, or trashed, going back to paper seems like a giant leap backwards. When you write something in a notebook, that&#8217;s it. So you sure as hell better stick it in the right notebook.</p>

<p>This organisational paralysis is completely unecessary, since wherever you write your mind maps, outlines, or doodles, you will be able to liberate them. But knowing that doesn&#8217;t really help. We are spoilt by the ubiquity of search for digital information. If the piece of information exists, whether it&#8217;s on the internet or your hard drive, you will be able to find it. How can you search a notebook? You could try writing the start and end dates on each notebook. It&#8217;s fairly easy to remember the rough period of time you had the idea, so you should be able to find it again if necessary.</p>

<p>Instead of buying more notebooks, I&#8217;m going to use the ones I&#8217;ve got, cramming them with as much information as I possibly can. And when I run out, I&#8217;m going to buy a plain pad of paper. Pads of paper are cheaper and more functional than notebooks. You can stockpile them for volume discounts; but <strong>resist</strong> the urge to keep starting a new pad for each project. Overpriced notebooks may be alluring, but they don&#8217;t make organisation easy. If you have a simple pad of paper (or even better, one with perforated sheets) you can just tear anything useful out and file it somewhere more permanent. Don&#8217;t panic if you want to tear something out and not do anything with it. I know that, although minimalism (especially in terms of possesions) has taken hold, getting rid of ideas is hard; it doesn&#8217;t need to be. You can treat each sheet of paper like an inbox item, and do it, delegate it, defer it, or delete it!</p></div>

        <div class="date">February  1, 2013 &bullet; <a href="/2013/02/01/snowballing-passion.html">∞</a></div> 
        <div class="excerpt"><p>Ideas, and more specifically capturing ideas, is something that I struggle with. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m worried that I don&#8217;t know where to put them, but I always seem to feel a sense of dread when I have an idea. It makes its way into my inbox, and then I&#8217;m paralysed. Admitting that this idea can be realised. Picking a next action. The correlation between concrete steps and seeing the idea birthed. It can be too much. So it sits there for a while, only to become a half-baked &#8220;look into&#8221; type task.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not how things get done. While projects are driven by next actions, you&#8217;ll never bring down a monster if you spend all day swatting flies. Projects are driven by passion - whether you know it or not. If you are passionate about a project then it will get done. I don&#8217;t mean passion as in something all consuming and highly romanticised. It can be short-lived. A fleeting five minutes spent engrossed in a Wikipedia article. Often, it turns into an hour or more solving some problem that cropped up whilst you were working. This kind of passion, and the relentless need to get some <em>specific</em> thing done, can often snowball.</p>

<p>As I sat down and reworked this site for the third time in two years, I was turning to the project after letting it sit dormant for a few months. Originally, I wanted to create some kind of dynamic landing page, a big advert for everything I do online. I have no idea why I was pretending that&#8217;s what I wanted my website to be. I just want somewhere to write. If I&#8217;m recognised on the Internet, I want it to be for my writing.</p>

<p>The rework turned out better than expected, and ended up being completed far sooner than I anticipated. Once I thought about why I wanted to change the aesthetics of my site, I realised it was not the aesthetics that I wanted to change. It was the purpose. This clarity drove me towards cleaning up the design, giving myself permission to change without the baggage of the old posts I would rather forget.</p>

<p>Discovering this purpose turned the project into a passion. Other things were left by the wayside as I pressed ahead with getting this finished. I&#8217;m glad I did. Finishing something big is better than finishing one hundred tiny things.</p>

<p>Let your passion snowball, driving you to complete bigger projects in great leaps, not tiny steps.</p></div>

        <div class="excerpt"><p>In the past few years, if you have been one of the very small number of people to have stumbled upon this blog, you will have noticed a distinct lack of two things in my posts: quality, and frequency. I&#8217;m not sure why it&#8217;s been such a struggle to really get this blog off the ground, but it has.</p>

<p>Whilst, like everyone else, I agree that resolutions are a pretty bad idea, I have <em>resolved</em> to expend significant effort this year in improving the kind of content I create and share on this very website.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I&#8217;m going to focus on creating the kind of content that I love to consume. Blogs like <a href='http://hackmake.org/'>Hack / Make</a>, <a href='http://macdrifter.com/'>Macdrifter</a>, and <a href='http://bettermess.com/'>A Better Mess</a>, as well as podcasts like <a href='http://5by5.tv/b2w'>Back To Work</a> are a huge influence on the way I work, and the way that I view tainted buzzwords like &#8220;productivity&#8221;. Whilst I don&#8217;t consider myself to be in the same league as those guys, it helps to know your heroes. Hopefully, in the coming months the posts here will drill down into the personal issues that we face with our struggle to get more done. By integrating deeper concepts, borrowed from areas such as Bhuddism, into the tips &#8216;n&#8217; tricks popular with the Lifehacker crowd, we can hope to create systems that are both meaningful and practical, without getting lost in the details.</p>

<p>Avoiding the numerous traps you set for your self on the journey to creating something can be a tricky business. When I decided to revamp and refocus this blog on what I actually care about, my next action was &#8220;find a new tool&#8221;. After only a few months with Jekyll, I was already looking for something new to fiddle with. Bombarding myself with &#8220;what if&#8221; questions, I was trying to prematurely optimise the blog with feature after feature, meaningless cruft that would only serve to distract from any posts that I have managed to craft into an engaging narrative. After a few days deep in the throes of a CMS identity crisis, something clicked: this doesn&#8217;t matter. The forever and a day that I could spend worrying about which static blogging system to play with, which font to use, which CSS framework to base the site, would only get in the way of the actual creating - the whole reason I wanted to overhaul this site in the first place.</p>

<p>Picking the right tool for the job isn&#8217;t easy, and with a virtually limitless amount of information available on the web, finding the perfect tool is damn near impossible. Don&#8217;t look for the perfect tool. Understanding what you really want, identifying your desired outcomes, frees you from concerns about tools. The meaning behind what you create, whether you have it in a professionally-themed Wordpress blog or a plain-text Gist on GitHub, remains the same. I don&#8217;t want to let meaning be obscured, or delayed, by tools.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s never been a better time to be mindful of the way you work.</p></div>

        <div class="excerpt"><p>Often, when processing journal RSS feeds, I&#8217;ll find quite a few articles that I want to read. I use <a href='http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/'>Papers2</a> to manage my papers, so the first thing I need to do is import these newly-downloaded files.</p>

<p>The <a href='https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid'><code>maid</code></a> gem makes this easy to do automatically. I&#8217;ve added the following rule to my <code>rules.rb</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>rule &#39;Add PDFs to Papers2&#39; do
  dir(&#39;~/Downloads/*.pdf&#39;).each do |path|
    is_paper = `mdfind -onlyin ~/Downloads/ computing`

      if is_paper.include?(path)
        `open -a Papers2 &quot;#{path}&quot;`
      end
  end
end</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s not perfect, but it <em>is</em> perfectly functional. Every time I run <code>maid
clean</code>, any PDFs that contain the word &#8220;computing&#8221; will be automatically imported into Papers. Obviously the word used to select papers will vary depending on your field, but the rule is trivial to modify.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s about becoming. Becoming is cyclical and perpetual. When you think you&#8217;ve “arrived”, you’re only just at the beginning of a new place. In this cycle of becoming is where you have to give and take between the burden and the solace of creating great things. At times, you&#8217;ll be burdened by your desire to make something insanely great. That will lead you into a path of suffering and discouragement; a place of character building and of gaining understanding. In the other season of that cycle comes actualization and a freedom to create the great things you just struggled to find in yourself.</p>
