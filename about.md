Most of my programming experience is in Java, but I can use C, C#, Ruby, Haskell and Racket with varying
degrees of proficiency. I also know HTML, CSS, and enough jQuery to get by.

Other things I enjoy are cooking (and eating), coffee, reading, and wasting time on numerous "lifehacks", my favourite being learning to shave with an old-fashioned safety razor.
