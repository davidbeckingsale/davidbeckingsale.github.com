        <div class="excerpt"><p>The best days are the ones when I don&#8217;t do anything in OmniFocus. What do I mean? When I&#8217;m living, I&#8217;m not worrying about my task list. I know that nothing is due. Nothing is going to fall apart while I&#8217;m away. This is the best part of GTD &#8211; the mind like water.</p>

<p>Whilst it&#8217;s not something that happens as often as I would like, I really appreciate it when it does happen. It makes me strive to improve the way I manage my &#8220;open loops&#8221;.</p></div>

<p>I removed <a href='http://daringfireball.net'>Daring Fireball</a> from my Google Reader for a while &#8211; the post volume is high, and to be honest, I&#8217;m more interested in &#8220;productivity&#8221; than technology news &#8211; but I recently resubscribed, and I&#8217;m glad I did!</p>

<p>John&#8217;s snappy comments, and insightful view into the business side of technology make it well worth following.</p></div>

        <div class="excerpt"><p>When watching the video of Koroush Dini speaking at <a href='http://omni.gp/thesetup/'>The OmniFocus Setup</a>, one thing that came to mind was how GTD (and OmniFocus) lets you accomplish <em>small wins</em>, where you knock a load of tasks off your list early in the day. This frees you up to tackle what Koroush describes as <em>creative tasks</em>, tasks where you don&#8217;t know what you are making until you have made it.</p>

<p>I love taking lots of small steps to make progress on projects early in the day, and feel like it removes the obligation to &#8220;accomplish&#8221; anything when I&#8217;m working on a more creative task later in the day. Creative tasks that I come up against are normally writing papers and debugging code, both of which can make it hard to feel like you&#8217;ve achieved much. When I&#8217;m safe in the knowledge that I <em>am</em> getting stuff done, I feel better about working on these open-ended challenges.</p></div>

        <div class="date">April 13, 2013 &bullet; <a href="/2013/04/13/on-keeping-a-notebook.html">∞</a></div> 
        <div class="excerpt"><p>Elizabeth Spiers over at <a href='http://lifehacker.com'>Lifehacker</a> has some interesting thoughts on reasons to keep a physical notebook:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those of us comfortable with the digital age, the plethora of note-taking apps makes idea capture fingertip-convenient. I&#8217;ve used Evernote for work purposes and keep most of my idea files in Google Docs. But that said, my first medium for idea capture is still pen and paper—usually in a highly disposable three-by-five paper notebook that I carry everywhere and fill up at a rate of about one a month. This is partly a function of immediacy (I don&#8217;t have to open an app and find a file) and partly a function of the fact that I&#8217;m terrible at typing on a smartphone and it takes me longer to get the words down if I try to do it digitally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good reason to prefer paper. Whilst apps like <a href='http://agiletortoise.com/drafts'>Drafts</a> do make it easy to quickly capture (and later process) text snippets on iOS, there is still a delay between thought and capture.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I also like the romance of physical handwriting, even though my atrocious penmanship falls somewhere between &#8220;five-year-old&#8221; and &#8220;average medical professional&#8221; and this sometimes means I&#8217;m unable to decipher pieces of what I wrote. I concentrate less when I&#8217;m typing and my first drafts often have missing phrases because my fingers have failed to catch up with my thoughts. Writing things down enforces slowness, and by extension, thoughtfulness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This <em>romance</em>, the nostalgic desire to use paper and pen, is probably one of the most compelling. Despite writing from a productivity context, there is something enticing about the feeling of abandoning systems and processes, and just capturing ideas like people have done for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>My main issue with keeping a paper notebook, as I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href='/2013/02/10/on-notebooks.html'>before</a>, is the fear of losing something. Without the powerful searches that are ubiquitous in our digital tools, what might happen to those thoughts?</p>

<p>This ties back to the romantic aspect of the notebooks - locking thoughts away in a notebook, waiting to be liberated.</p></div>
